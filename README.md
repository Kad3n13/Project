In this project, I utilized Cisco Packet Tracer to complete all three modules and construct a functional home network. Through the three modules, I engaged in various tasks aimed at understanding and implementing networking concepts effectively.

Module 1 involved laying the groundwork by comprehensively learning about network fundamentals, including network devices, protocols, and the OSI model. I practiced configuring routers, switches, and end devices, ensuring a solid understanding of their functionalities.

Moving on to Module 2, I delved deeper into network design and implementation. This module allowed me to explore different network topologies, such as star, bus, and mesh, and understand their respective advantages and limitations. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in subnetting, VLAN configuration, and troubleshooting common network issues.

In Module 3, I focused on advanced networking concepts, including dynamic routing protocols, access control lists (ACLs), and network security measures. Through practical exercises, I honed my skills in configuring routing protocols like OSPF and EIGRP, implementing ACLs to control traffic flow, and enhancing network security through features like port security and DHCP snooping.
